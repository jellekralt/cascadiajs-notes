# Programming the Cloud with JavaScript
* Issue with Droplets
	* Cant see whats inside
	* Can't duplicate it
	* Cant scale it out easily
	* Can't recover from disaster

* Types of Tools
	* Configuration management
		* Chef 
		* Puppet
		* Ansible
		* SaltStack
	* Provisioning
		* Terraform
		* AWS CloudFormation
		* Azure Resource Manager

* They're declarative: we express the *what* an the tools determine the *how*

* Reliable
* Repeatable
* Replicable
* Testable
* Self documentational

* App-friendly resources
	* Function
	* Table
	* Event Record
	* Route

* AWS Cloud Development Kit
	* Javascript
* Pulumi



## Questions
* Does it "auto-generate" resources for you in the cloud?
	* If it does, How do you deal with costs?
	* If it doesnt, do you have to "define" all the resources by hand upfront?
	* Or are there budgets or limits?

* Benefits HTTP/2
	* Multiplexing and concurrency
	* Stream dependencies
	* Header compression
	* Server push
* Why HTTP/3
	* TCP head-of-line blocking
		* http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-tcphol.html
* HTTP/3 over QUIC
	* QUIC is built on UDP
	* Protocols don't update that fast -> routes don't get replaced quickly

# Binary encoding in JavaScript
* github.com/cztomsik/graffiti
* github.com/servo/bincode
* WASM understands only number and binary data (at least today)
* Avoid encoding strings into utf-8. It is slow
* Look up SharedArrayBuffer
